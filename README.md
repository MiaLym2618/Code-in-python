# Developer's Note
This is a passion project I created while learning Python. Throughout the process, I encountered several challenges — such as enemies sliding off platforms and bugs in collision detection. It took me about a week of trial and error to gradually solve most of them.
Although there are still a few imperfections, I'm proud of what I’ve made. It feels like I’ve fulfilled a childhood dream by bringing one of my favorite games to life in my own way.
